    <h1>The History of Sultan's Palace</h1>
    <p> Joseph Gardette was the man who had local architects build him the three and a half story mansion. 
    After a few years he sold it to Jean LePrete and bought it for $20,049 in 1839. LePrete was incredibly 
    wealthy and added all the iron to the balcony in the 1850's. When the Civil War erupted in the 1860's 
    the LePrete family financial stability crumbled. They couldn't maintain the mansion anymore due to the 
    economic downturn from the war. LePrete was desperate to get ride of the mansion so he leased his mansion 
    in the French Quarter. He was randomly approached by a man and said that LePrete's brother that was a Sultan
    wanted to rent the Property. He agreed and signed all the contracts. A month later a ship arrives in the port 
    of New Orlean's, women, men in a military uniforms, the brother of Sultan, and Sultan himself were pouring out 
    of the boat. There was also a whole bunch of fine furniture pieces pouring out. It was then named the Sultan's 
    Palace. The Palace was then filled with activity everyday and night.</p>

    <!--This is the story of how it's haunted-->
    <h1>Why is it Haunted?</h1>
    <p>A couple months after they moved in a very bad storm rolled in one night. The storm caused the whole city
    to hunker down and board up all there windows. The next morning the sky was bright blue as if the storm never 
    happened. A man who was on a walk walked past the Palace and noticed blood dripping down the front steps. He ran
    to the police, as the police arrived the blood was even thicker. The police knocked the door down and there was corpses
    all over the ground, limbs were missing and some flayed open. In the courtyard they found Sultan buried, with one hand
    out of the dirt clawing for help. The police never found out who did it or why someone would do such a thing.</p>
